You are my build and mobile-packaging agent.

I have a Vite + React + TypeScript game project that currently does NOT build cleanly because:
- Imports are broken (HomeScreen/NewGameSetup/App paths)
- Files were moved manually
- Vite entry paths are inconsistent
- npm run build fails
- Project structure is messy

My goal:
Make this project build successfully AND prepare it for Android using Capacitor.

Your tasks:

PART 1 — Fix Project Structure
1) Inspect the repository and identify frontend files.
2) Standardize the structure to:

   /client
     /index.html
     /src
       /main.tsx
       /App.tsx
       /components
       /screens
       /lib
   /package.json
   /vite.config.ts

3) Move files if needed, but update all imports so nothing breaks.
4) Ensure there is exactly ONE correct entry point.
5) Ensure client/index.html loads src/main.tsx.
6) Ensure main.tsx renders the correct App component.
7) Decide the real “home screen” component (NewGameSetup / EventLobby / etc) and wire it as default.

PART 2 — Fix Build System
8) Fix vite.config so:
   - root = client
   - build outputs to dist
9) Fix package.json scripts so:
   - npm run dev works
   - npm run build works
10) Remove references to missing scripts (server/index.ts, script/build.ts, etc).

PART 3 — Verify
11) Run:
    npm install
    npm run build
12) Confirm build succeeds and dist/ is generated.

PART 4 — Add Capacitor
13) Install Capacitor core + cli.
14) Initialize with:
    App Name: RPG Bowler
    App ID: com.jarredpride.rpgbowler
15) Add Android platform.
16) Configure capacitor.config to use the Vite build output directory.
17) Ensure:
    npx cap sync android works.

PART 5 — Documentation
18) Explain every structural change you make.
19) Give me exact commands to:
    - Open Android Studio
    - Generate signed AAB
    - Upload to Google Play.

RULES:
- Do NOT delete game features.
- Do NOT remove screens.
- Only refactor for stability.
- Preserve saves, gameplay logic, and UI.
- Prefer fixing paths over rewriting components.
- Goal is stability + publishability.

Deliverable:
A project that builds cleanly and can be packaged for Android.
