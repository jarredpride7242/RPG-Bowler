Update my existing mobile game RPG Bowler to add a complete long-term progression system including: Career Ladder, Rankings, Sponsors, Seasonal Story Beats, and Prestige/New Game+. Keep the current game fully playable and do NOT break existing saves. Use safe defaults for any new fields.

Hard requirements:
	•	Keep 3 save slots and ensure old saves load with defaults
	•	Keep the existing energy system and weekly reset logic
	•	Keep go pro requirement: player must maintain 200+ average to apply for professional membership
	•	Do not remove existing leagues/tournaments; extend them
	•	All new systems must be visible in UI with clear progress indicators

⸻

1) Career Ladder System (New “Career” tab)

Add a new tab: Career (rename/insert without breaking nav).
The Career tab must show a tiered ladder with current tier, next tier requirements, and unlocked content.

Career Tiers (example, adjust names if needed)
	1.	Amateur (start)
	2.	League Regular
	3.	Regional Contender
	4.	State Champion Track
	5.	National Circuit
	6.	Pro Applicant (requires 200+ avg)
	7.	Professional
	8.	Elite Tour

Tier Requirements (use checklists)

Requirements should combine:
	•	minimum average (or “peak avg” + “current avg”)
	•	number of league weeks completed
	•	number of tournaments entered/won
	•	ranking threshold (see rankings system)
	•	optional “license exam” event (simple checklist confirmation pop-up, not a mini-game)

Tier Unlocks

Each tier unlocks at least one of:
	•	new leagues/tournament categories
	•	higher prize pools
	•	new sponsor tiers
	•	cosmetic title/badge
	•	“Season Story Beat” chapters

The Career tab should include:
	•	a progress bar to next tier
	•	a “Career badge” displayed in the top UI bar

⸻

2) Rankings System (New “Rankings” screen)

Add a Rankings section accessible from Career tab or a new sub-tab.

Rankings should include multiple leaderboards:
	•	Local
	•	Regional
	•	State
	•	National
	•	Pro Tour (only after Professional status)

Implementation
	•	Generate a pool of AI bowlers (e.g., 100–300) with names, archetypes, and skill ranges that scale by region level.
	•	Each “week” or “event”, simulate AI results and update rankings.
	•	Player’s rank moves based on their performance in leagues/tournaments.
	•	Show:
	•	player current rank number (e.g., #42 Regional)
	•	movement indicator (↑/↓ since last update)
	•	top 10 list and “near you” list

Rival System (lightweight but impactful)
	•	Create 5–10 recurring rivals that appear often in events.
	•	Show rivalry card: name, rival rank, last head-to-head outcome.
	•	Occasionally trigger a “Rival Match” highlight in Seasonal Story Beats.

⸻

3) Sponsorship System (New “Sponsors” tab or section)

Add a Sponsors system with offers that unlock based on Career tier + rankings.

Sponsor Tiers
	•	Local Sponsor (early)
	•	Regional Sponsor
	•	National Sponsor
	•	Pro Sponsor

Sponsor Contracts

Each sponsor contract should define:
	•	contract length in weeks
	•	weekly stipend OR performance bonus
	•	perks (examples: discount at ball shop, small energy boost, free entry fees, bonus XP)
	•	requirements to maintain (e.g., average above X, finish top Y in events, keep ranking above threshold)

Sponsor UI
	•	“Available Offers” list with requirements + benefits clearly shown
	•	“Active Sponsor” panel with:
	•	weeks remaining
	•	objectives progress
	•	earned bonuses
	•	“Sponsor Reputation” meter that improves when you meet objectives and worsens when you fail.

Fail Conditions
	•	If player repeatedly fails objectives, sponsor may terminate contract with a warning first.
	•	Provide a fair grace system (1 warning week before termination).

⸻

4) Seasonal Story Beats (Post-season + In-season moments)

Expand seasons to feel like a career narrative, without heavy writing.

A) Season Structure

Define a “Season” as:
	•	League season length (existing or set default)
	•	Key checkpoints:
	•	Pre-season (after draft equivalent if you have it; otherwise after offseason)
	•	Mid-season (Week 10)
	•	Post-season (after championship / major tournament)

B) Story Beat Pop-ups

Add short, punchy “story beat” popups at:
	•	start of season
	•	week 10
	•	end of season

Story beats should reflect:
	•	ranking progress
	•	rival encounters
	•	sponsor developments
	•	career tier unlock moments
	•	highlight achievements and setbacks

Make beats dynamic using variables:
	•	if player improved rank a lot → “breakout season” beat
	•	if player had slump → “comeback arc” beat
	•	if won major → “headline win” beat

Include 2–3 player choices sometimes (low effort):
	•	“Train harder” (cost energy, boost next event)
	•	“Rest” (restore energy, small performance variance reduction)
	•	“Media day” (improve sponsor reputation, costs energy)

⸻

5) Prestige / New Game+ (Legacy System)

After the player reaches Professional (or completes first Pro season), unlock Prestige called:
Legacy Reset (New Game+).

Prestige Rules
	•	Player may reset career progression back to Amateur/early tier
	•	Keep Legacy Points earned from:
	•	season awards (MVP etc.)
	•	titles (league champ, national wins)
	•	pro achievements
	•	high average milestones

Legacy Shop (Permanent Bonuses)

Add “Legacy Shop” where points can buy permanent upgrades that carry into future runs, like:
	•	+starting cash
	•	+starting energy cap (or +weekly energy bonus)
	•	+small bonus XP gain
	•	unlock extra perk slot (if perks exist) OR small boost to a stat category
	•	cheaper entry fees

Ensure these are balanced and capped so the game doesn’t break.

UI
	•	Show Lifetime Stats:
	•	total seasons played
	•	total titles
	•	highest average achieved
	•	total Legacy Points earned/spent
	•	Add a clear warning modal before resetting.

⸻

6) Integration Details (must not break existing game)
	•	Add new state fields to the save schema:
	•	careerTier, careerProgress, rankings, rivals, sponsor, sponsorReputation, legacyPoints, prestigeCount, seasonStoryFlags, lifetimeStats
	•	Provide migrateSave() so old saves load without errors.
	•	Ensure all screens are mobile-friendly and do not overwhelm the player: keep each tab clean and scrollable.
	•	Add tuning constants at top for:
	•	AI bowler count
	•	ranking volatility
	•	sponsor objective difficulty
	•	legacy point earnings rate

⸻

Deliverable

A working update where the player can:
	•	view and progress through a Career Ladder
	•	see rankings change week to week
	•	accept and manage sponsorships
	•	experience season story beats at checkpoints
	•	unlock prestige/legacy reset and spend legacy points
while keeping the game stable, readable, and fun.
